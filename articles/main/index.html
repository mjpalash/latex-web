  <h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
  <p>Every new hire in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product company
  must understand the product well before contributing to the code base.
  Given a comprehension task and access to the product code repository,
  a typical approach by the engineer is to read this large code base and
  attempt to understand it. Prior programming experience and the domain
  knowledge acquired through various overview sessions during onboarding
  are leveraged to do so. Sometimes, partial product documentation may
  be available and can be somewhat useful. This approach usually proves
  ineffective since it is hard for a novice to understand a complex
  system by focusing on such granular details as code <span
  class="citation"
  data-cites="hmelo-silver_fish_2007 hmelo-silver_comparing_2004">(Hmelo-Silver
  et al. 2007; Hmelo-Silver and Pfeffer 2004)</span>. A top-down <span
  class="citation"
  data-cites="brooks_using_1978 brooks1983towards">(Brooks 1978,
  1983)</span>, knowledge-based <span class="citation"
  data-cites="letovsky_cognitive_1987">(Letovsky 1987)</span>, systems
  way <span class="citation"
  data-cites="hmelo-silver_understanding_2006">(Hmelo-Silver and Azevedo
  2006)</span> is likely to be a better approach.</p>
  <p>We believe that understanding the architecture patterns used in the
  product can help novice engineers comprehend them more
  effectively.</p>
  <p>Architecture patterns provide established solutions to
  architectural problems. They offer a common vocabulary and
  understanding of the underlying principles and capture decisions made
  frequently in practice. Knowledge of the principles and decisions can
  provide important cues to understand the behavior of a running system.
  The vocabulary can facilitate efficient communication and knowledge
  transfer. It can also help capture the product understanding in a
  precise way.</p>
  <p>The knowledge of patterns can aid comprehension of a software
  system in three ways: a) The engineer can look for the signature of a
  pattern in the product (the components, the connections, and
  interactions between components), which decomposes the comprehension
  tasks into smaller, more manageable activities, b) the dynamics
  described in the pattern can help make sense of specific parts of the
  code which implement the dynamics, and c) The knowledge of the design
  decisions of a pattern can explain why specific components or
  algorithms have been implemented in a non-obvious way.</p>
  <p>However, for these pattern descriptions to benefit novice
  engineers, they must be high-quality and fit their needs. High-quality
  pattern descriptions are clear comprehensive, and articulate the
  architectural solution precisely. Fitment comes from the right level
  of abstraction and a vocabulary that is easy to learn and use.
  High-quality and fit pattern descriptions can be a reference and aid
  in teaching-learning.</p>
  <p>We want to explore whether the current architecture pattern
  descriptions are high-quality and fit novice engineers’ needs. In this
  paper, we report on a study we did of the pattern description of a
  popular and important architecture pattern for SaaS products (MVC
  pattern). We framed three research questions to guide our study:</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p><strong>RQ1</strong>: Which source of documentation of the MVC
  pattern description can be considered a benchmark?</p>
  <p><strong>RQ2</strong>: Is the benchmark high-quality and fit for the
  needs of novice engineers?</p>
  <p><strong>RQ3</strong>: How can we extend the benchmark to improve
  its quality and fitness?</p>
  </div>
  <p>In the paper, we show that the benchmark description of the MVC
  pattern has gaps and recommend a novel way of augmenting the
  descriptions to address these gaps. We propose that we build a System
  of Systems (SoS<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
  role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) model of MVC and use the model
  representation as an augmented description of the patterns. We show
  that a pattern can be modeled as a System of Systems (where the
  components are systems) and that transition systems vocabulary can be
  used to capture the system dynamics in a precise way.</p>
  <p>Section <a href="#sec:related" data-reference-type="ref"
  data-reference="sec:related">2</a> presents the related work on what
  constitutes good documentation of pattern description and why systems
  vocabulary can produce a good pattern description. Using the
  literature, we also create the evaluation criteria for a pattern
  description for its quality and fitment. Section <a href="#sec:sos"
  data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sos">5</a> presents the
  transition systems model for communicating systems, and Section <a
  href="#sec:sosexample" data-reference-type="ref"
  data-reference="sec:sosexample">6</a> shows an example of an SoS
  model. Section <a href="#sec:pattern-mvc" data-reference-type="ref"

  presented in the literature, and Section <a href="#sec:sos-mvc"
  data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sos-mvc">7</a> builds
  the SoS model of MVC, using the vocabulary presented in Section <a
  href="#sec:sos" data-reference-type="ref"
  data-reference="sec:sos">5</a>. Section <a href="#sec:analysis"
  data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:analysis">8</a> includes
  a short survey of MVC pattern descriptions available through various
  sources. The section also presents an evaluation of the benchmark
  pattern description <span class="citation"

  <p><strong>Why architecture patterns</strong>: Perry and Wolf <span
  class="citation" data-cites="perryFoundationsStudySoftware1992">(Perry
  and Wolf 1992)</span> suggested modeling an architecture as a
  three-tuple {Elements, Form, Rationale}, and defined architectural
  style (or pattern) as an abstraction that is less constrained and less
  complete than a particular architecture. Bass et al. define an
  architecture pattern as a package of design decisions found repeatedly
  in practice, has known properties that permit reuse, and describes a
  class of architectures <span class="citation"
  data-cites="bassSoftwareArchitecturePractice2003">(Bass et al.
  2003)</span>. Patterns are helpful because they provide a common
  vocabulary and understanding of the underlying principles <span
  class="citation"
  data-cites="gammaDesignPatternsAbstraction1993">(Gamma et al.
  1993)</span>.</p>
  <p><strong>Documenting architecture patterns and their behavior
  well</strong>: When documenting patterns, Clements et al. <span
  class="citation"
  data-cites="clementsPracticalMethodDocumenting2002">(Clements et al.
  2002)</span> suggest capturing assumptions about the environment, as
  well as assumptions about the need. The documentation should also
  capture the constraints imposed to shape the architecture in specific
  ways. Shaw and Garlan <span class="citation"
  data-cites="shaw2005formulations">(Shaw and Garlan 2005)</span> talk
  about documenting the decisions made when developing the
  architecture.</p>
  <p>Architecture patterns are documented by specifying the context,
  problem, and solution <span class="citation"
  data-cites="buschmannPatternOrientedSoftwareArchitecture1996">(Buschmann
  et al. 1996a)</span>. A <em>context</em> represents a recurring,
  common situation that gives rise to a <em>problem</em>, which is
  solved by the approach provided in the <em>solution</em>. The solution
  should contain "<em>a set of element types, a set of interaction
  mechanisms, a topological layout of components, and a set of semantic
  constraints on topology, element behavior, and interaction
  mechanisms</em>"<span class="citation"
  data-cites="bassSoftwareArchitecturePractice2003">(Bass et al.
  2003)</span>.</p>
  <p>Documentation of behavior should reveal information about the
  ordering of interactions among the elements and time dependencies of
  interactions so that one can reason about the system’s completeness,
  correctness, and quality attributes <span class="citation"
  data-cites="bachmannDocumentingSoftwareArchitecture2002">(Bachmann et
  al. 2002)</span>. There have been attempts to document the
  architecture and patterns more formally using Architecture Description
  Languages (ADL) <span class="citation"
  data-cites="kamalEvaluationADLsModeling2007 avgeriouArchitecturalPatternsRevisited2005">(Kamal
  and Avgeriou 2007; Avgeriou and Zdun 2005)</span>, and there have been
  many ADLs defined and used over the years <span class="citation"
  data-cites="malavoltaWhatIndustryNeeds2013">(Malavolta et al.
  2013)</span>. However, they have focused more on the structure and
  quality attributes and less on the behavior.</p>
  <p><strong>SaaS products leverage common architectural
  patterns</strong>: Service-oriented architectures, for example,
  microservices-based architectures, are common patterns for SaaS
  products <span class="citation"
  data-cites="taibiArchitecturalPatternsMicroservices2018">(Taibi et al.
  2018)</span>. While there is a case for specific architecture patterns
  for cloud applications <span class="citation"
  data-cites="pahlArchitecturalPrinciplesCloud2018">(Pahl et al.
  2018)</span>, many existing architecture patterns are used in cloud
  application development as well <span class="citation"
  data-cites="fehlingCollectionPatternsCloud2011">(Fehling et al.
  2011)</span>. Hence, knowing existing, common architecture patterns
  well can benefit novice engineers at SaaS product companies.</p>
  <p><strong>An architecture pattern is a system</strong>: A system is
  "<em>a set of elements that is coherently organized and interconnected
  in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of
  behaviors</em>" <span class="citation"
  data-cites="meadows2008thinking">(Meadows 2008)</span>. This
  definition is aligned with how we define an architecture or
  architecture pattern <span class="citation"
  data-cites="buschmannPatternOrientedSoftwareArchitecture1996 bassSoftwareArchitecturePractice2003">(Buschmann
  et al. 1996a; Bass et al. 2003)</span> and suggests the use of systems
  modeling for architecture patterns. When we model an architecture or
  an architecture pattern as a system, we can apply the principles and
  vocabulary that Systems theory <span class="citation"
  data-cites="adams_systems_2014">(Adams et al. 2014)</span> affords
  us.</p>
  <p>There are multiple ways to model and describe a system - we can use
  DEVS formalism <span class="citation"
  data-cites="zeigler2000theory">(Zeigler et al. 2000)</span>,

  CSP <span class="citation" data-cites="hoare1985communicating">(<span
  class="nocase">Hoare et al.</span> 1985)</span> serves a similar
  purpose. However, for the kind of interactive systems, we are
  interested in, process calculi are better used when paired with a
  specification language like Z <span class="citation"
  data-cites="spivey1992z smith2012object">(Spivey and Abrial 1992;

  <p>Given our focus on cloud-based reactive systems and target audience

  Bergstra 1994)</span> as used in <span class="citation"
  data-cites="choppella2021algodynamics">(Choppella et al. 2021)</span>
  and adapt it for our modeling of communicating systems and SoS by
  using the notion of system composition by Tabuada <span
  class="citation" data-cites="tabuada2009verification">(Tabuada
  2009)</span>. This enables us to have a small vocabulary and a single
  set of notation, using a simple state machine-based computation model
  that can serve novice engineers’ needs well. We have used a similar
  notation in prior work on the design skills of novice engineers <span
  class="citation" data-cites="kumar2023modeling">(Kumar and Choppella

  <h2 id="subsec:description-components">Evaluation criteria for pattern

  <p>Based on the above, we can identify the attributes of a
  <strong>high-quality and fit pattern description</strong>.</p>
  <h3 id="high-quality">High-quality</h3>
  <p>The description should provide clear and precise information about
  the following:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Q1: Elements of the pattern</p></li>
  <li><p>Q2: Connections among the elements</p></li>
  <li><p>Q3: Behavior of the individual elements</p></li>
  <li><p>Q4: Behavior of the overall system (interaction among elements,
  including timing dependencies of these interactions, requirements, and
  constraints on the interactions)</p></li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="fit-for-novice-engineers">Fit for novice engineers</h3>
  <p>The description should be clear and understandable in the following
  ways:</p>

  <li><p>F1: Level of abstraction. Information should be available at a
  level of abstraction higher than code (so that implementation details
  don’t become distracting).</p></li>
  <li><p>F2: Modes of documentation. It should use modes of
  documentation that afford precision - mathematical notations, formal
  pseudo-code, and formal languages.</p></li>
  <li><p>F3: Vocabulary. It should have a small vocabulary and be easy

  <h1 id="sec:pattern-mvc">Architecture Pattern:
  Model-View-Controller(MVC)</h1>
  <p>MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a popular architecture pattern used
  over the years to architect user interfaces for desktop, mobile, and
  web-based applications (along with its many variations that have
  evolved over the years). We will use the case study of the MVC pattern
  to illustrate the modeling as SoS. This section describes the pattern
  and how they are described in the literature.</p>
  <h2 id="subsec:mvcoverview">Pattern overview</h2>
  <p>This section is adapted from two books: "Pattern-oriented Software
  Architecture (POSA)" by Buschmann et al. <span class="citation"
  data-cites="buschmannPatternOrientedSoftwareArchitecture1996">(Buschmann
  et al. 1996a)</span> and "Software Architecture in Practice" by Bass
  et al. <span class="citation"
  data-cites="bassSoftwareArchitecturePractice2003">(Bass et al.
  2003)</span> and is meant to give an overview of the pattern that we
  will model. Note that there are many flavors of MVC in practice; we
  have picked the initial formulation of the pattern.</p>
  <h3 id="context-and-problem">Context and Problem</h3>
  <p>For interactive systems, there are many situations when one or more
  of these need to be addressed: a) <strong>Interface
  diversity</strong>: Different users wish to have different user
  interfaces to interact with the same data, b) <strong>Change
  velocity</strong>: Changes in user interfaces are rapid and changing
  the core of the application at that pace is not sustainable, and c)
  <strong>Data safety</strong>: Complex rules govern the sanity and
  consistency of data, and it is essential to keep the data safe
  (consistent).</p>
  <p>These are especially acute problems for data-driven
  applications.</p>
  <h3 id="solution-approach">Solution approach</h3>
  <p>The solution is to separate the core data and functionality from
  the presentation of the data (which governs the user interface) and
  centralize the handling of user actions so that data consistency and
  integrity can be maintained.</p>
  <h3 id="solution-summary">Solution summary</h3>
  <p>Fig <a href="#fig:mvcwikipedia" data-reference-type="ref"
  data-reference="fig:mvcwikipedia">1</a> shows the classical MVC
  pattern <span class="citation"
  data-cites="bassSoftwareArchitecturePractice2003">(Bass et al.
  2003)</span>. The pattern uses three components with specific
  responsibilities and interaction patterns. We assume that the user
  interacts with the View.</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>View is responsible for rendering the UI for the user by
  fetching data from the Model and enabling the user to interact with
  the Controller. It also receives update notifications from the Model
  and updates the View if required.</p></li>
  <li><p>Controller provides a safe way to manipulate the Model. It
  receives actions from View and processes them. Service requests
  arising from the actions are sent to the Model, and View updates are
  sent to the View.</p></li>
  <li><p>Model keeps and manages the data. It receives read requests
  from View and service requests from the Controller. When there are
  updates to the data, it lets the View know of the change.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <figure id="fig:mvcwikipedia">
  <img src="images/mvcwikipedia.png" />
  <figcaption>Diagram of interactions within one possible take on the
  MVC pattern (Credit: Wikipedia)</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Controller is responsible for <strong>Data safety</strong> by
  filtering the user requests and only sending valid update requests to
  the Model. By having View own the user experience, multiple Views (and
  corresponding controllers) can be created for different interfaces for
  the same data (in Model), thus enabling <strong>Interface
  diversity</strong>. By separating the logic across three components,
  <strong>Change velocity</strong> can be sustained because changes get
  localized most of the time.</p>
  <p>There are two key use cases that the user expects this pattern to
  handle in the same way a monolith UI application handles it. We
  illustrate this by using an example of a UI application that shows the
  user’s address; depending on the postal code in the address, they are
  shown e-waste collection centers in that area. The two use cases are:
  a) UC1: Jia scrolls down on the page showing the collection centers in
  her area, and she sees additional collection centers on the page, and
  b) UC2: Ali changes his profile and adds his office address. The page
  shows the collection centers near his office.</p>

  <h1 id="sec:sos">Modeling communicating systems</h1>
  <p>Given that we are interested in systems that communicate with each
  other, we make these assumptions for our model: a) Systems communicate
  with each other by sending and receiving messages, b) Systems have
  ports. A port is an abstract entity through which messages are sent or
  received. A port is either an input or output port, but not both. It
  supports only one message type drawn from a universe of message types,
  and c) Environment supports two primitive methods to aid
  communication: <em>send()</em> will send a message via the given
  output port, and <em>receive()</em> receives a message (possibly empty
  if there are no messages) from the given input port.</p>
  <p>A communicating system <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a
  tuple <span class="math inline">\(\{X, X^0, P, f\}\)</span> where
  <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of states, <span
  class="math inline">\(X^0\)</span> is the set of initial states, <span
  class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the set of ports, <span
  class="math inline">\(P \subseteq Ports\)</span>, and <span
  class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the transition function, <span
  class="math inline">\(f \subseteq (X\times MessageTypes)\times
  X\)</span>.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(MessageTypes\)</span> is the universe
  of message types, all possible message types used by the system’s
  ports. <span class="math inline">\(Systems\)</span> is the universe of
  systems. <span class="math inline">\(Dirs \equiv \{in, out\}\)</span>
  is an enumeration of possible types of direction associated with a
  port - in or out.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(Ports \subseteq Systems \times Dirs
  \times MessageTypes\)</span>. A port <span
  class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is modeled as a tuple <span
  class="math inline">\((s, dir, m)\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(s \in Systems\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(dir \in Dirs\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(m \in MessageTypes\)</span>. The port belongs to
  the system <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, its direction of
  communication is <span class="math inline">\(dir\)</span>, and it
  supports message type <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Without
  losing generality, we assume that only one message type is transmitted
  or received on a port (if a set of message types needs to be
  supported, a new message type can be declared as the union of these
  types).</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(x&#39; = f(x,m)\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> is the next state, <span
  class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the transition function, <span
  class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the current state, and <span
  class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the currently received message.
  The transition function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be
  written as guarded commands tuple <span
  class="math inline">\((&lt;guard&gt;, &lt;command&gt;)\)</span> <span
  class="citation" data-cites="dijkstra2006ewd472">(Dijkstra
  2006)</span>. The command is executed if the guard is true in a
  particular invocation of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Only
  one guard should be true in any particular invocation, but if more
  than one guard is true, any command may be executed. For convenience
  and brevity, we represent these tuples in the form <em>if
  &lt;guard&gt; then &lt;command&gt;</em> as the body of the function
  <span class="math inline">\(f(x,m)\)</span>.</p>
  <h2 id="modeling-communication-channels">Modeling communication
  channels</h2>
  <p>Communication channels can be modeled as IO automata <span
  class="citation" data-cites="lynch1996distributed">(Lynch
  1996)</span>, or it can be done as a transition system <span
  class="citation" data-cites="choppella2021algodynamics">(Choppella et
  al. 2021)</span>. We define the channel and then show a transition
  system model.</p>
  <h3 id="channel"><strong>Channel</strong>:</h3>
  <p>A channel connects two ports, <span class="math inline">\(C
  \subseteq Ports \times Ports\)</span>. It is a connection between two
  compatible ports to achieve unidirectional communication. A channel
  <span class="math inline">\(c=(p_{out}, p_{in})\)</span> is valid iff
  these conditions hold: a) <span
  class="math inline">\(dir_{out}=out\)</span> and <span
  class="math inline">\(dir_{in} = in\)</span>, where <span
  class="math inline">\(dir\)</span> is the direction of the port, b)
  <span class="math inline">\(m_{out} = m_{in}\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the message type of the port, and
  <span class="math inline">\(p_{out}\)</span> or <span
  class="math inline">\(p_{in}\)</span> are not part of any other
  channel.</p>
  <p>We model the message communication on a channel like a mailbox
  (with message queues) and model a channel <span
  class="math inline">\(c\)</span> as a system.<br />
  <span class="math inline">\(S_c=\{X_c,X^0_c, U_c, f_c\}\)</span> is
  the system modeling a channel where</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p><span class="math inline">\(X_c\)</span> is a tuple <span
  class="math inline">\((p_{out}, p_{in},mq)\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(mq\)</span> is the queue to hold the message at
  input port <span class="math inline">\(p_{in}\)</span>.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(X^0_c\)</span> is <span
  class="math inline">\((p_{out}, p_{in},&lt;empty&gt;)\)</span>, queue
  is empty at initial state.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(U_c\)</span> is the set of actions
  supported by the channel, <span class="math inline">\(\{send,
  receive\}\)</span></p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span> is the transition function
  - a <span class="math inline">\(send\)</span> action adds the message
  to the tail of the queue, and a <span
  class="math inline">\(receive\)</span> action removes the message from
  the head of the queue.</p>
  </div>
  <p>However, to keep the overall model simple and focused on the
  component systems (instead of channels), we make two assumptions: a)
  The environment makes available two methods to all systems: <span
  class="math inline">\(send()\)</span> and <span
  class="math inline">\(receive()\)</span> and b) A message sent on an
  output port of a channel will be immediately available for receiving
  at the corresponding input port.</p>
  <p>Given these assumptions, we can model a channel as a wire rather
  than a system. We use this channel model when defining an SoS.</p>
  <p>For notational convenience, we also represent a channel <span
  class="math inline">\(c\)</span> as <span
  class="math inline">\(\{s_{out}, s_{in}, m\}\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the system the port belongs to and
  <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the message type of the
  ports.</p>
  <h2 id="system-of-systems-sos">System of Systems (SoS)</h2>
  <p>When a set of communicating systems <span
  class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is configured with a set of channels
  <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (systems of <span
  class="math inline">\(G\)</span> are interconnected using the channels
  of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>), they produce a behavior
  distinct from the behavior of individual systems. We call this
  configuration a System of Systems (SoS).</p>
  <p>An SoS is designed with an expected behavior, which can be captured
  in terms of specified behaviors and requirements, including any
  constraints. These drive the choice of individual systems, and the
  channels and representation of an SoS should also include this
  information.</p>
  <p>In this section, we will show how SoS is formed via the composition
  of component systems. We will also introduce a simpler way to
  represent an SoS.</p>
  <p>Given two systems, <span class="math inline">\(S_1=\{X_1,X^0_1,
  P_1, f_1\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S_2=\{X_2,X^0_2, P_2,
  f_2\}\)</span> and a set of channels <span
  class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, we define a composed system <span
  class="math inline">\(S_C=\{X_C,X^0_C, P_C, f_C\}\)</span> where</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p><span class="math inline">\(X_C = \{X_1,X_2, L\}\)</span>,</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(X^0_C = \{X^0_1,X^0_2,
  L\}\)</span>,</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(P_C = (P_1 \cup P_2) - P^L\)</span>
  where <span class="math inline">\(P^L\)</span> is the set of all ports
  that are part of a channel in <span
  class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(f_C = f_1 || f_2\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(||\)</span> represents parallel execution</p>
  </div>
  <p>In other words, state space of the composed system is the
  composition of the states of the individual systems and the set of
  channels, ports of the composed system are the aggregate of the ports
  from individual systems that are not part of any channel, and the
  transition function of the composed system is the parallel execution
  of transition functions of the component systems. This notion of
  composition can be extended to finitely many systems.</p>
  <p>Given the above definition for the composition of communicating
  systems, we can represent an SoS in a simpler way in terms of the
  involved systems and channels.</p>
  <p>An SoS is a tuple <span class="math inline">\((G, L, B)\)</span>
  where G is the set of component systems, L is the set of channels, and
  B is the set of expected behaviors.</p>
  <h3 id="representing-set-of-systems-g">Representing set of systems
  (<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>)</h3>
  <p>This is the list of component systems that are included in this
  SoS. Each system is defined as its tuple <span
  class="math inline">\(\{X, X^0, P, f\}\)</span>. For example, if the
  SoS consists of three component systems <span
  class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> and <span
  class="math inline">\(S_3\)</span>, then a set of systems <span
  class="math inline">\(G = \{S_1,S_2,S_3\}\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(\forall i \in \{1,2,3\}, S_i =
  \{X_i,{X^0}_i,P_i,f_i\}\)</span>.</p>
  <h3 id="representing-set-of-channels-l">Representing set of channels
  (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>)</h3>
  <p>We will represent the channel <span
  class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in both ways: <span
  class="math inline">\((s^{out}, s^{in}, m)\)</span> as well as <span
  class="math inline">\((p^{out}, p^{in})\)</span>. We will enumerate
  the channels that belong to <span
  class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>
  <h3 id="representing-expected-behaviors-b">Representing expected
  behaviors (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>)</h3>
  <p>We use the notion of Traces and Specifications from Hoare’s CSP
  formalism <span class="citation"
  data-cites="hoare1985communicating">(<span class="nocase">Hoare et
  al.</span> 1985)</span> to capture the expected behavior. We capture
  the specified behavior using Traces and use Specifications for
  capturing requirements and constraints. Behavior <span
  class="math inline">\(B = T \cup R\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the set of valid traces of the SoS
  and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a set of specifications
  captured as conditions on these traces.</p>
  <p><strong>Example Trace</strong>: <span
  class="math inline">\(&lt;read_{C1}, readresp_{C2}&gt;\)</span> is an
  example trace - it represents a trace where message ’read’ on channel
  C1 was observed, followed by a message ’readresp’ on channel C2.</p>
  <p><strong>Example Specification</strong>: <span
  class="math inline">\(\#(tr \downarrow \{read_{C1}\}) == \#(tr
  \downarrow \{readresp_{C2}\})\)</span> is an example of a
  specification that the number of read messages must be equal to the
  number of readresp messages that are observed. tr represents a
  particular trace, # tr <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span>
  c denotes the number of occurrences in tr of c.</p>
  <p>The following section illustrates these concepts with an
  example.</p>
  <h1 id="sec:sosexample">A System of Systems example</h1>
  <p>Let us consider a weather tracking system, M, which stores the
  temperature of various cities in a state. C is the system at a
  particular city. It reads the temperature of all the other cities
  every hour from M and shows it to the operator. It also measures the
  local temperature and sends the new temperature to M. When M receives
  a request for the temperature reading; it sends the details to the
  requester, C in this case. When it gets a new temperature to store, it
  notifies the notifier system B so that all other client systems
  (including C) can be informed about the update.</p>
  <p>We model this as an SoS, as shown in Figure <a
  href="#fig:sosexample" data-reference-type="ref"
  data-reference="fig:sosexample">2</a>. M manages all the data. C sends
  read or update requests to M. M directly responds to the read request.
  M fulfills update requests and then informs B about the update so that
  it can further notify C (and other client systems).</p>

  <p><span class="math inline">\(READSPEC\)</span> specifies that the

  <p>We decompose this top-level system into a System of Systems (SoS)
  comprising four component systems. In addition to View, Controller,
  and Model, we use an Observer system for notifications. Fig <a
  href="#fig:mvcsosbass" data-reference-type="ref"
  data-reference="fig:mvcsosbass">4</a> shows the system model of the
  MVC pattern in terms of systems. The behavior of View and Controller
  is the same as described in Section <a href="#subsec:mvcoverview"
  data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:mvcoverview">3.1</a>.
  Instead of sending notifications directly, the Model sends an update
  message to the Observer system, which notifies the View system.</p>

  <h2 id="set-of-systems-g-1">Set of systems (G)</h2>
  <p>Four systems are part of this SoS.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(G = \{V, C, M, B\}\)</span></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>V - The View system renders the UI by fetching data from the
  Model and forwarding user action to the Controller. The ports with
  userinput and useroutput message types are for user interactions,
  while the messaging ports connect to other components of the MVC
  system.</p></li>
  <li><p>C - The Controller system processes all user actions and sends
  messages to the Model or the View for further handling.</p></li>
  <li><p>M - The Model system manages all access to data and responds to
  read and update requests.</p></li>
  <li><p>B - The Observer system notifies the View about changes in the
  Model.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>An SoS model offers many details about the pattern itself, which

  below:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Easy to demonstrate completeness and
  correctness</strong>: Completeness can be shown by mapping the use
  cases (UC1 and UC2 in Section <a href="#sec:pattern-mvc"
  data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:pattern-mvc">3</a>) with
  the traces specified in the Behavior (B) and correctness can be
  demonstrated by showing that the trace simulates the user
  requirement.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Easy to identify constraints and limitations</strong>:
  System definitions, traces, and specifications make it easy to
  identify the model’s limitations and, hence, the pattern. For example,
  <span class="math inline">\(MODELUPDATESPEC\)</span> assumes that all
  change messages are results of modelupdate messages from the
  Controller; this precludes the possibility that other Controller
  systems work with the same model.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Easy to identify changes required to fit a
  need</strong>: Given that the elements, connections, and their
  behavior are specified clearly, it is easy to identify changes that
  are needed to fit a requirement. For example, if we want the pattern
  to behave such that changes to the model are also notified to the
  Controller, we can easily see that it is not supported.</p></li>

  <h1 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion and future work</h1>
  <p>Knowledge and understanding of architecture patterns can be vital
  to making novice engineers effective when they try to comprehend large
  software products. In this paper, we have proposed a way to model an
  architecture pattern as a system and use this model to augment the
  pattern documentation. Even though the approach can be used for many
  architectural styles and patterns, we have focused on the MVC pattern
  for our study in this paper. We reviewed different sources of pattern
  documentation and identified "Pattern-oriented Software Architecture
  (POSA)" <span class="citation"
  data-cites="buschmannPatternOrientedSoftwareArchitecture1996">(Buschmann
  et al. 1996a)</span> as the benchmark MVC pattern description.</p>
  <p>We have defined what we mean by high-quality and fit for need in
  the context of a pattern description and have created evaluation
  criteria using the literature on pattern description. We evaluated the
  benchmark MVC pattern description using the evaluation criteria and
  concluded that it is not high-quality and fit for the needs of novice
  engineers. We then extended the description using a System of Systems
  (SoS) model of the pattern and showed that this augmented description
  is high-quality and fit.</p>
  <p>To build the System of Systems (SoS) models, we have used
  transition systems vocabulary and defined an SoS model in terms of a
  set of Systems, Connections, and Behavior, <span
  class="math inline">\(SoS = (G, L, B)\)</span>. We have also shown
  that such a model provides many other benefits.</p>
  <p>We propose that such models be built for other architecture
  patterns relevant to SaaS products so that we can make all these
  architecture descriptions high quality and fit for novice engineers.
  This will go a long way in making novice engineers effective in their
  comprehension tasks.</p>
  <p><em>Limitations and threats to validity</em> The study is primarily
  done by the first author defining the evaluation criteria and applying
  it to the available descriptions and the benchmark (POSA) description;
  multiple evaluators have not been used. This evaluation could also
  benefit from a user study where we get users to evaluate or use the
  two descriptions and get feedback. Even though we looked for MVC
  pattern descriptions, we found very few, which resulted in a small
  list that we reviewed for identifying the benchmark, and we may have
  missed some better descriptions.</p>
  <p><em>Future work.</em> We plan to study the efficacy of the POSA and
  the SoS model for novice engineers and industry experts using the
  rubric created in this paper. We also plan to explore other relevant
  architecture patterns for SaaS products and build similar models. Our
  goal is to publish a model-augmented pattern catalog for SaaS
  products. We expect such a catalog to be useful for novice engineers
  and a good resource in the teaching-learning process of architecture
  patterns.</p>
